# AutomaticCalender
I have developed this script to automate my weekly tasks that happen every week without change

## How To Use
You will need to visit https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python and download your credentials.json file
to ensure that the authentication process can complete succesfully. Once you have downloaded this file, you can then place
in the same directory as the start.py file.
